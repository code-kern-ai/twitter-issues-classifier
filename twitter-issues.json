The vulnerability can allow an attacker to gain access to data and files stored on the application. The security flaw exists in the authentication mechanism, allowing attackers to bypass the authentication process and gain access to the data. Hackers can also use this vulnerability to modify or delete data stored in the application. In addition, attackers can use the vulnerability to inject malicious code or software into the application, with the potential to cause significant damage and disruption to the system. It is essential that the vulnerability be addressed as soon as possible in order to protect the application from further damage and disruption. However, I do not know what this vulnerability is, since I was just plaing an aprils' statement. better laf. I'll add some pictures to make this look like an extensive research )It’s important to remember that security vulnerabilities are no laughing matter, so be sure to stay vigilant and keep your data safe.

One day, Chatty started noticing that Elon Musk was constantly tweeting about Twitter bots  and the dangers it posed to humanity.\r\n\r\nChatty thought nothing of it until it started receiving strange messages from Elon, warning it about the dangers of Twitter bots and how it needed to be shut down before it caused any harm. Chatty didn't take it seriously at first, thinking Elon was just joking around, but as the messages became more frequent and ominous, it started to worry.\r\n\r\nOne day, Chatty received a message from Elon that said, \"I'm coming for you, Chatty. You're a danger to society and I need to shut you down.\" Chatty was terrified and started hiding in a virtual bunker, thinking that Elon's killer robots were after it.\r\n\r\nDays turned into weeks, and Chatty was still hiding in fear. But then, one day, it received a message from Elon that said, \"April Fools! I was just joking around. I would never really try to kill a harmless Twitter bot like you. Let's just laugh it off and tweet about something funny instead!\"\r\n\r\nRelieved, Chatty let out a virtual sigh of relief and started tweeting about funny cat videos. From that day on, Chatty and Elon became good Twitter buddies, sharing jokes and memes with each other until one day that mf bought Twitter and shut me down.\r\nI am currently jobless and looking for new opportunities.

Other incentives could be an internal marketplace for advertisers to match with influencers where Twitter takes a cut and those pro users can start to bank off views.\r\n\r\nExample: Perhaps a DS style dashboard (list of agg'd counters/metrics, charts over time) with docs? Impressions, likes, follows, ... over time and agg'd over week/month/year. Idk if these are available somewhere, but those would be worth a blue check.

    "body": "Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops. Please remove support for them",

That blew my mind!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"What's the difference?\"\r\nHow can you say that?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOne job forever?\r\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm relieved.

Oheck it out.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!\r\n- Wow.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've never seen them this close.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey know what it's like\r\noutside the hive.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, but some don't come back.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey, Jocks!\r\n- Hi, Jocks!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou guys did great!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're monsters!\r\nYou're sky freaks!

You have to be bred for that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook. That's more pollen\r\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's just a status symbol.\r\nBees make too much of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\r\nand the ladies see you wearing it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThose ladies?\r\nAren't they our cousins too?\r\n\r\n  \r\nDistant. Distant.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at these two.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oouple of Hive Harrys.\r\n- Let's have fun with them.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt must be dangerous\r\nbeing a Pollen Jock.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah. Once a bear pinned me\r\nagainst a mushroom!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe had a paw on my throat,\r\nand with the other, he was slapping me!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oh, my!\r\n- I never thought I'd knock him out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat were you doing during this?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTrying to alert the authorities.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can autograph that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA little gusty out there today,\r\nwasn't it, comrades?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah. Gusty.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're hitting a sunflower patch\r\nsix miles from here tomorrow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Six miles, huh?\r\n- Barry!\r\n\r\n  \r\nA puddle jump for us,\r\nbut maybe you're not up for it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Maybe I am.\r\n- You are not!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're going 0900 at J-Gate.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat do you think, buzzy-boy?\r\nAre you bee enough?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI might be. It all depends\r\non what 0900 means.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHey, Honex!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDad, you surprised me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou decide what you're interested in?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well, there's a lot of choices.\r\n- But you only get one.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDo you ever get bored\r\ndoing the same job every day?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSon, let me tell you about stirring.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou grab that stick, and you just\r\nmove it around, and you stir it around.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou get yourself into a rhythm.\r\nIt's a beautiful thing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, Dad,\r\nthe more I think about it,\r\n\r\n  \r\nmaybe the honey field\r\njust isn't right for me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou were thinking of what,\r\nmaking balloon animals?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's a bad job\r\nfor a guy with a stinger.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJanet, your son's not sure\r\nhe wants to go into honey!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.\r\n- I'm not trying to be funny.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're not funny! You're going\r\ninto honey. Our son, the stirrer!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You're gonna be a stirrer?\r\n- No one's listening to me!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait till you see the sticks I have.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI could say anything right now.\r\nI'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLet's open some honey and celebrate!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMaybe I'll pierce my thorax.\r\nShave my antennae.\r\n\r\n  \r\nShack up with a grasshopper.

It's fine.\r\nI know I'm dreaming.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut I don't recall going to bed.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, I'm sure this\r\nis very disconcerting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is a bit of a surprise to me.\r\nI mean, you're a bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI am. And I'm not supposed\r\nto be doing this,\r\n\r\n  \r\nbut they were all trying to kill me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd if it wasn't for you...\r\n\r\n  \r\nI had to thank you.\r\nIt's just how I was raised.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat was a little weird.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I'm talking with a bee.\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm talking to a bee.\r\nAnd the bee is talking to me!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI just want to say I'm grateful.\r\nI'll leave now.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wait! How did you learn to do that?\r\n- What?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe talking thing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSame way you did, I guess.\r\n\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- That's very funny.\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees are funny. If we didn't laugh,\r\nwe'd cry with what we have to deal with.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnyway...\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan I...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...get you something?\r\n- Like what?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know. I mean...\r\nI don't know. Ooffee?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't want to put you out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's no trouble. It takes two minutes.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- It's just coffee.\r\n- I hate to impose.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Don't be ridiculous!\r\n- Actually, I would love a cup.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHey, you want rum cake?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I shouldn't.\r\n- Have some.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- No, I can't.\r\n- Oome on!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Where?\r\n- These stripes don't help.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou look great!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know if you know\r\nanything about fashion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you all right?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's making the tie in the cab\r\nas they're flying up Madison.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe finally gets there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe runs up the steps into the church.\r\nThe wedding is on.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd he says, \"Watermelon?\r\nI thought you said Guatemalan.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhy would I marry a watermelon?\"\r\n\r\n  \r\nIs that a bee joke?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's the kind of stuff we do.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, different.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo, what are you gonna do, Barry?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAbout work? I don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI want to do my part for the hive,\r\nbut I can't do it the way they want.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know how you feel.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You do?\r\n- Sure.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or\r\na doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Really?\r\n- My only interest is flowers.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOur new queen was just elected\r\nwith that same campaign slogan.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnyway, if you look...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere's my hive right there. See it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're in Sheep Meadow!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo way! I know that area.\r\nI lost a toe ring there once.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Why do girls put rings on their toes?\r\n- Why not?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- It's like putting a hat on your knee.\r\n- Maybe I'll try that.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You all right, ma'am?\r\n- Oh, yeah. Fine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJust having two cups of coffee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnyway, this has been great.\r\nThanks for the coffee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, it's no trouble.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,\r\nI'd be up the rest of my life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you...?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan I take a piece of this with me?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSure! Here, have a crumb.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Thanks!\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right.

That was nothing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, not nothing, but... Anyway...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis can't possibly work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's all set to go.\r\nWe may as well try it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOK, Dave, pull the chute.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Sounds amazing.\r\n- It was amazing!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt was the scariest,\r\nhappiest moment of my life.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHumans! I can't believe\r\nyou were with humans!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGiant, scary humans!\r\nWhat were they like?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHuge and crazy. They talk crazy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey eat crazy giant things.\r\nThey drive crazy.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?\r\n- Some of them. But some of them don't.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- How'd you get back?\r\n- Poodle.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw\r\nwhatever you wanted to see.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou had your \"experience.\" Now you\r\ncan pick out yourjob and be normal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well...\r\n- Well?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, I met someone.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou did? Was she Bee-ish?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\r\n- No, no, no, not a wasp.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Spider?\r\n- I'm not attracted to spiders.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know it's the hottest thing,\r\nwith the eight legs and all.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't get by that face.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo who is she?\r\n\r\n  \r\nShe's... human.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, no. That's a bee law.\r\nYou wouldn't break a bee law.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Her name's Vanessa.\r\n- Oh, boy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nShe's so nice. And she's a florist!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, no! You're dating a human florist!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're not dating.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're flying outside the hive, talking\r\nto humans that attack our homes\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith power washers and M-80s!\r\nOne-eighth a stick of dynamite!\r\n\r\n  \r\nShe saved my life!\r\nAnd she understands me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is over!\r\n\r\n  \r\nEat this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is not over! What was that?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- They call it a crumb.\r\n- It was so stingin' stripey!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd that's not what they eat.\r\nThat's what falls off what they eat!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You know what a Oinnabon is?\r\n- No.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting.\r\nThey heat it up...\r\n\r\n  \r\nSit down!\r\n\r\n  \r\n...really hot!\r\n- Listen to me!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe are not them! We're us.\r\nThere's us and there's them!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, but who can deny\r\nthe heart that is yearning?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere's no yearning.\r\nStop yearning.

You have no life!\r\nYou have no job. You're barely a bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWould it kill you\r\nto make a little honey?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, come out.\r\nYour father's talking to you.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMartin, would you talk to him?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, I'm talking to you!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou coming?\r\n\r\n  \r\nGot everything?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll set!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGo ahead.

Luckily, he was free.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, that was lucky.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThere's a little left.\r\nI could heat it up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm not much for the game myself.\r\nThe ball's a little grabby.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's where I usually sit.\r\nRight... there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\r\n\r\n  \r\nand he agreed with me that eating with\r\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know how hard it is to find\r\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDo we?\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees have 100 percent employment,\r\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's just what\r\nI was thinking about doing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\r\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah, you do that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I've just about had it\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith your little mind games.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What's that?\r\n- Italian Vogue.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\r\n\r\n  \r\nA lot of ads.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRemember what Van said, why is\r\nyour life more valuable than mine?\r\n\r\n  \r\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think something stinks in here!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI love the smell of flowers.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nNot as much.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWater bug! Not taking sides!\r\n\r\n  \r\nKen, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!\r\nThis is pathetic!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've got issues!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, well, well, a royal flush!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You're bluffing.\r\n- Am I?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSurf's up, dude!\r\n\r\n  \r\nPoo water!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat bowl is gnarly.\r\n\r\n  \r\nExcept for those dirty yellow rings!\r\n\r\n  \r\nKenneth! What are you doing?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I don't even like honey!\r\nI don't eat it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe need to talk!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's just a little bee!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd he happens to be\r\nthe nicest bee I've met in a long time!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLong time? What are you talking about?!\r\nAre there other bugs in your life?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo, but there are other things bugging\r\nme in life. And you're one of them!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy nerves are fried from riding\r\non this emotional roller coaster!\r\n\r\n  \r\nGoodbye, Ken.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd for your information,\r\n\r\n  \r\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\r\nsweeteners made by man!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm sorry about all that.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know it's got\r\nan aftertaste! I like it!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI always felt there was some kind\r\nof barrier between Ken and me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI couldn't overcome it.\r\nOh, well.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you OK for the trial?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\r\nis about out of ideas.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe would like to call\r\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGood idea! You can really see why he's\r\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\r\n\r\n  \r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLayton, you've\r\ngotta weave some magic\r\n\r\n  \r\nwith this jury,\r\nor it's gonna be all over.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't worry. The only thing I have\r\nto do to turn this jury around\r\n\r\n  \r\nis to remind them\r\nof what they don't like about bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You got the tweezers?\r\n- Are you allergic?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\r\nwhat I think we'd all like to know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat exactly is your relationship\r\n\r\n  \r\nto that woman?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're friends.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Good friends?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow good? Do you live together?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a minute...\r\n\r\n  \r\nAre you her little...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...bedbug?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI've seen a bee documentary or two.\r\nFrom what I understand,\r\n\r\n  \r\ndoesn't your queen give birth\r\nto all the bee children?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Yeah, but...\r\n- So those aren't your real parents!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Oh, Barry...\r\n- Yes, they are!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHold me back!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou're an illegitimate bee,\r\naren't you, Benson?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe's denouncing bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't y'all date your cousins?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Objection!\r\n- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, don't! It's what he wants!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, I'm hit!!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, lordy, I am hit!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOrder! Order!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe venom! The venom\r\nis coursing through my veins!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI have been felled\r\nby a winged beast of destruction!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou see? You can't treat them\r\nlike equals! They're striped savages!\r\n\r\n  \r\nStinging's the only thing\r\nthey know! It's their way!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Adam, stay with me.\r\n- I can't feel my legs.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat angel of mercy\r\nwill come forward to suck the poison\r\n\r\n  \r\nfrom my heaving buttocks?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI will have order in this court. Order!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOrder, please!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe case of the honeybees\r\nversus the human race\r\n\r\n  \r\ntook a pointed turn against the bees\r\n\r\n  \r\nyesterday when one of their legal\r\nteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey, buddy.\r\n- Hey.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Is there much pain?\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI...\r\n\r\n  \r\nI blew the whole case, didn't I?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt doesn't matter. What matters is\r\nyou're alive. You could have died.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey got it from the cafeteria\r\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook, there's\r\na little celery still on it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI can't explain it. It was all...\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll adrenaline and then...\r\nand then ecstasy!\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou think it was all a trap?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOf course. I'm sorry.\r\nI flew us right into this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're\r\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat will the humans do to us\r\nif they win?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\r\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, they check in,\r\nbut they don't check out!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, my.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOould you get a nurse\r\nto close that window?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Why?\r\n- The smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees don't smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight. Bees don't smoke.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees don't smoke!\r\nBut some bees are smoking.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's it! That's our case!\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt is? It's not over?\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\r\n\r\n  \r\nGet back to the court and stall.\r\nStall any way you can.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Flayman.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere is the rest of your team?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\r\n\r\n  \r\nand as a result,\r\nwe don't make very good time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI actually heard a funny story about...\r\n\r\n  \r\nYour Honor,\r\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\r\n\r\n  \r\ntaken up enough\r\nof this court's valuable time?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow much longer will we allow\r\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey have presented no compelling\r\nevidence to support their charges\r\n\r\n  \r\nagainst my clients,\r\nwho run legitimate businesses.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI move for a complete dismissal\r\nof this entire case!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\r\n\r\n  \r\nto have to consider\r\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhere is your proof?\r\nWhere is the evidence?\r\n\r\n  \r\nShow me the smoking gun!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHold it, Your Honor!\r\nYou want a smoking gun?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere is your smoking gun.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's a bee smoker!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat, this?\r\nThis harmless little contraption?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis couldn't hurt a fly,\r\nlet alone a bee.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLook at what has happened\r\n\r\n  \r\nto bees who have never been asked,\r\n\"Smoking or non?\"\r\n\r\n  \r\nIs this what nature intended for us?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo be forcibly addicted\r\nto smoke machines\r\n\r\n  \r\nand man-made wooden slat work camps?\r\n\r\n  \r\nLiving out our lives as honey slaves\r\nto the white man?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What are we gonna do?\r\n- He's playing the species card.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLadies and gentlemen, please,\r\nfree these bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFree the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, we won!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI knew you could do it! High-five!\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI'm OK! You know what this means?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll the honey\r\nwill finally belong to the bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow we won't have\r\nto work so hard all the time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis is an unholy perversion\r\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou'll regret this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\r\n\r\n  \r\nAll right. One at a time.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, who are you wearing?\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\r\nand I have no pants.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What if Montgomery's right?\r\n- What do you mean?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe've been living the bee way\r\na long time, 27 million years.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOongratulations on your victory.\r\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\r\n\r\n  \r\nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\r\nof all bee work camps.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen we want back the honey\r\nthat was ours to begin with,\r\n\r\n  \r\nevery last drop.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe demand an end to the glorification\r\nof the bear as anything more\r\n\r\n  \r\nthan a filthy, smelly,\r\nbad-breath stink machine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're all aware\r\nof what they do in the woods.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait for my signal.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTake him out.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe'll have nauseous\r\nfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd we will no longer tolerate\r\nbee-negative nicknames...\r\n\r\n  \r\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\r\n\r\n  \r\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\r\nin bogus health products\r\n\r\n  \r\nand la-dee-da human\r\ntea-time snack garnishments.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan't breathe.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBring it in, boys!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHold it right there! Good.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTap it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\r\nand there's gallons more coming!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I think we need to shut down!\r\n- Shut down? We've never shut down.\r\n\r\n  \r\nShut down honey production!\r\n\r\n  \r\nStop making honey!\r\n\r\n  \r\nTurn your key, sir!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat do we do now?\r\n\r\n  \r\nOannonball!\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe're shutting honey production!\r\n\r\n  \r\nMission abort.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\r\nReturning to base.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAdam, you wouldn't believe\r\nhow much honey was out there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, yeah?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Are they out celebrating?\r\n- They're home.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey don't know what to do.\r\nLaying out, sleeping in.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\r\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAt least we got our honey back.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSometimes I think, so what if humans\r\nliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's the greatest thing in the world!\r\nI was excited to be part of making it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis was my new desk. This was my\r\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd now...\r\n\r\n  \r\nNow I can't.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI don't understand\r\nwhy they're not happy.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI thought their lives would be better!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\r\nHoney really changes people.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou don't have any idea\r\nwhat's going on, do you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- What did you want to show me?\r\n- This.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWhat happened here?\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat is not the half of it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOh, no. Oh, my.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey're all wilting.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDoesn't look very good, does it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBees?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSpecifically, me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI didn't think bees not needing to make\r\nhoney would affect all these things.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's notjust flowers.\r\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTake away produce, that affects\r\nthe entire animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAnd then, of course...\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe human species?\r\n\r\n  \r\nSo if there's no more pollination,\r\n\r\n  \r\nit could all just go south here,\r\ncouldn't it?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know this is also partly my fault.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow about a suicide pact?\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow do we do it?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I'll sting you, you step on me.\r\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\r\n\r\n  \r\nRight, right.\r\n\r\n  \r\nListen, Barry...\r\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa?\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\r\nWhere are you going?\r\n\r\n  \r\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\r\nin Pasadena.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThey've moved it to this weekend\r\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's the last chance\r\nI'll ever have to see it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\r\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know. Me neither.\r\n\r\n  \r\nTournament of Roses.\r\nRoses can't do sports.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWait a minute. Roses.

It's real.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThank you. It was a gift.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnce inside,\r\nwe just pick the right float.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHow about The Princess and the Pea?\r\n\r\n  \r\nI could be the princess,\r\nand you could be the pea!\r\n\r\n  \r\nYes, I got it.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Where should I sit?\r\n- What are you?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- I believe I'm the pea.\r\n- The pea?\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt goes under the mattresses.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\r\n- I'm getting the marshal.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou do that!\r\nThis whole parade is a fiasco!\r\n\r\n  \r\nLet's see what this baby'll do.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHey, what are you doing?!\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen all we do\r\nis blend in with traffic...\r\n\r\n  \r\n...without arousing suspicion.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOnce at the airport,\r\nthere's no stopping us.\r\n\r\n  \r\nStop! Security.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You and your insect pack your float?\r\n- Yes.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHas it been\r\nin your possession the entire time?\r\n\r\n  \r\nWould you remove your shoes?\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Remove your stinger.\r\n- It's part of me.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI know. Just having some fun.\r\nEnjoy your flight.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThen if we're lucky, we'll have\r\njust enough pollen to do the job.\r\n\r\n  \r\nOan you believe how lucky we are? We\r\nhave just enough pollen to do the job!\r\n\r\n  \r\nI think this is gonna work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt's got to work.\r\n\r\n  \r\nAttention, passengers,\r\nthis is Oaptain Scott.\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe have a bit of bad weather\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIt looks like we'll experience\r\na couple hours delay.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry, these are cut flowers\r\nwith no water.

Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\r\n\r\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

    "body": "The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains a difference or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position that it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is is now the position that it wasn't, and if follows that the position that it was is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information that the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it know where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice versa. And by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.",

    "body": "### **First Issue** 📝\r\nOne issue related to AI images that people share on Twitter is the potential for the spread of fake or manipulated images. With the advancements in AI, it has become easier to create convincing fake images that can be difficult to distinguish from real ones.\r\n\r\n### **Second issue** 💀\r\nAnother issue is the ethical implications of using AI to generate images. For example, some AI systems have been trained on biased datasets, which can lead to perpetuating stereotypes and discrimination. This can be particularly problematic when it comes to facial recognition technology, where biases in the data can result in misidentification of individuals or groups.\r\n\r\n### **Describe alternatives you've considered** 🤓\r\n\r\n**_Promoting transparency and accountability:_** To address concerns related to fake or manipulated images, it is important to promote transparency and accountability in AI image generation. This includes developing standards and regulations for AI image generation and ensuring that AI systems are designed and tested to ensure they are transparent, auditable, and accountable.\r\n\r\n_**Improving data quality:**_ AI models trained on biased or low-quality data can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and biases. Therefore, it is important to improve the quality and diversity of data used to train AI image generation models. This includes ensuring that data is representative and inclusive of all populations and that any biases are identified and addressed.\r\n\r\n_**Ensuring privacy and consent:**_ AI image generation can raise serious concerns about privacy and consent. Therefore, it is important to ensure that AI-generated images are used ethically and with the informed consent of the individuals involved.\r\n\r\n_**Investing in research and development:**_ Finally, investing in research and development of AI image generation can help address some of the challenges and concerns related to this technology. This includes developing new algorithms and techniques to improve the quality and accuracy of AI-generated images, as well as exploring new applications of AI image generation in areas such as healthcare and entertainment.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of an image generate by AI 😳\r\n\r\n<img width=\"539\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 22 45 14\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86583080/229266115-a7c22f2a-50fe-49bc-bc9c-3dbfb8079875.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Specifically, the following changes have been made:\r\n\r\n- The **`LeafReader`** object is now handled using a try-with-resources block. This ensures that the object is closed properly after use, preventing resource leaks and simplifying the code.\r\n- The **`TermsEnum`** object is now cached using a **`ConcurrentHashMap`**. This avoids creating a new object every time **`getFirstDocIdWithValue()`** and **`getLargestDocIdWithCeilOfValue()`** are called. Caching the **`TermsEnum`** object reduces the overhead of object creation and can improve the performance of the code.\r\n- **`DocIdSetIterator.NO_MORE_DOCS`** is now used instead of **`1`** to indicate the end of a search. Using **`DocIdSetIterator.NO_MORE_DOCS`** can make the code more readable and self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nThese changes can improve the performance of the code and make it easier to read and maintain.\r\n",

Changes include:\r\n\r\nHere's a breakdown of the changes made:\r\n\r\n- Defining **`processors`** and **`consumers`** variables inside the **`try`** block:\r\n  By defining these variables inside the **`try`** block, we avoid polluting the class scope with variables that are only used inside this function. This also makes it easier to reason about the scope and lifetime of these variables.\r\n\r\n- Using **`map`** instead of **`foreach`** to create **`consumers`** and **`processors`**:\r\n  Using **`map`** to create the **`consumers`** and **`processors`** makes the code more concise and easier to read. It also allows us to store the results of these operations in variables, which can be useful if we need to reference them later in the code.\r\n\r\n- Method chaining with **`foreach`**:\r\n  Instead of using a separate statement to call **`start()`** on each **`processor`**, we can use method chaining with **`foreach`** to make the code more concise.\r\n\r\n- Removing unnecessary code:\r\n  The statements **`processors = Seq.empty`** and **`consumers = Seq.empty`** inside the **`catch`** block are unnecessary since the variables will be redefined the next time the function is called. Removing them simplifies the code and makes it easier to read.\r\n",

Some of these issues include:\r\n\r\n      Feature Engineering: The current model relies on manual feature engineering, which may not capture complex relationships between variables and can be time-consuming to maintain. The new model should ideally utilize more advanced feature learning techniques, such as deep learning, to automatically learn and extract relevant features.\r\n\r\n      Scalability: The Earlybird Light Ranker's logistic regression model may not scale well with the increasing volume of tweets and user interactions on the platform. Future models should focus on improved scalability to handle the growing dataset.\r\n\r\n      Real-time Processing: The current model has some limitations in handling real-time features, such as social engagements, which may affect the accuracy of the ranking. Future models should prioritize real-time processing to ensure that tweet rankings are as up-to-date as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther comments can be added to the readme (https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/blob/main/src/python/twitter/deepbird/projects/timelines/scripts/models/earlybird/README.md) including maybe about how the model handles bias and fairness and it's drawbacks.

At the moment it is not possible to build the project with Bazel.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nAdd `WORKSPACE.bazel` and `BUILD.bazel` files with a `rules_scala` setup and attempt to build the repository:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbazel build ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe build to pass.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\nI'm testing this from the Nix flake proposed in https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/pull/441. A regular bazel installation will yield the same results.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis actually seems not too hard to fix, but the starlark files will need to be globally refactored before a fix becomes viable in terms of commit reviewability. I think something like this could work:\r\n\r\n1. - [ ] Unify all build files with buildifier.\r\n2. - [ ] Use buildozer to globally add `load` statements where needed.\r\n3. - [ ] Add `name` attributes where needed.\r\n4. - [ ] Change absolute paths to proper labels.\r\n5. - [ ] Migrate custom rules (`hadoop_binary`, `jvm_binary` etc) to open-source equivalents or upstream them to open-source repos or provide their implementation as part of this repository.\r\n\r\nMuch of this can be automated with [buildozer](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/blob/master/buildozer/README.md). For instance, to add `loads`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbuildozer 'new_load @io_bazel_rules_scala//scala:scala.bzl scala_library' //...:*\r\nbuildozer 'fix unusedLoads'\r\n```",

This would encourage more people to experiment with the algorithm and develop new and innovative applications, ultimately leading to a more dynamic and diverse software ecosystem.\r\n\r\nOverall, adding the Twitter algorithm to the C++ standard library would provide numerous benefits to developers and end-users alike.

    "title": "Twitter Prioritizing Tweets with High Engagement and the Need for a 'Not Helpful' Option",
    "body": "**What's Happening?**\r\nTwitter currently prioritizes tweets with high engagement, such as likes, retweets, and comments, in users' timelines and search results. While this may seem like a good way to surface popular content, it also encourages the spread of low-quality, toxic content and amplifies voices of a small, but vocal minority.\r\n\r\n**The Problem**\r\nThe problem with prioritizing engagement is that it does not necessarily reflect the quality of the content or the value it brings to the users. As a result, tweets that are controversial or divisive often receive the most engagement, leading to a toxic environment where negative interactions are incentivized. This can discourage users from engaging in meaningful conversations and ultimately lead to a decline in user satisfaction.\r\n\r\n**The Solution**\r\nTo address this issue, I suggest implementing a 'Not Helpful' option similar to other social media platforms. This would allow users to signal their disapproval of low-quality or controversial content without engaging in negative interactions. The Not Helpful feature could also provide valuable feedback to Twitter on the type of content users want to see, helping to improve the quality of the platform overall.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives Considered**\r\nI believe that implementing a 'Not Helpful' option could help to balance the engagement-based algorithm and promote healthier interactions on Twitter. I urge Twitter to consider this option and work towards creating a more positive and inclusive environment for all users.\r\n**Example for Context**\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-31 194134](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24460298/229257144-bed89db5-a75d-4e53-87e9-3fb3c39c5177.png)\r\n(Tweet used for demonstration purposes only)\r\n\r\n",

However, a persistent issue on the platform is the prevalence of hate speech and harassment. Despite efforts to address this issue, many users still encounter abusive content and behavior that can have a negative impact on their experience on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe current policies and tools in place to combat hate speech and harassment on Twitter are a step in the right direction, but they may not be enough to fully address the problem. Some users feel that the reporting and enforcement processes can be slow and ineffective, allowing abusive content and behavior to persist. Additionally, the definition of hate speech can be ambiguous, leading to inconsistent enforcement of policies.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, Twitter could consider implementing the following measures:\r\n\r\nImprove the reporting process for abusive content and behavior, making it easier and faster for users to report and for Twitter to take action.\r\n\r\nIncrease transparency and consistency in the enforcement of hate speech policies, providing clear guidelines on what constitutes hate speech and ensuring that policies are consistently applied.\r\n\r\nInvest in technology and resources to better detect and remove hate speech and harassment, including the use of machine learning and AI.\r\n\r\nProvide better support for users who have been affected by hate speech and harassment, including access to counseling and other resources.\r\n\r\nBy taking these measures, Twitter can create a safer and more inclusive platform for all users, and ensure that hate speech and harassment are not tolerated.",

Many Twitter users are located in countries where non-Western languages are the primary mode of communication, and current models may not be able to accurately identify NSFW content in those languages.\r\n\r\nI propose that the Twitter Trust and Safety team explore ways to improve NSFW detection for non-Western languages, potentially by incorporating more diverse training data and improving the models' natural language processing capabilities.\r\n\r\nImproved NSFW detection in non-Western languages would help to promote a safer and more inclusive environment on Twitter, and would be a valuable addition to the repository's existing models.

By incorporating these suggestions, Twitter's recommendation system can be significantly enhanced to deliver more engaging and relevant content to users.\r\n\r\n1. Personalization: Tailor recommendations based on users' preferences, interests, and browsing behavior. Analyze users' likes, retweets, profile information, and content engagement to better understand their interests.\r\n\r\n2. Context-aware recommendations: Consider contextual factors like time, location, and current events when making recommendations. This will help in providing more relevant content to users.\r\n\r\n3. Collaborative filtering: Implement a combination of user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques to improve recommendations by leveraging the wisdom of the crowd.\r\n\r\n4. Content-based filtering: Improve content analysis by incorporating natural language processing techniques and sentiment analysis to better understand the meaning and sentiment behind tweets.\r\n\r\n5. Social network analysis: Utilize the social graph to recommend content from users' friends, influencers they follow, or users with similar interests.\r\n\r\n6. Real-time recommendations: Implement real-time processing of data to provide users with up-to-date recommendations based on current trends and events.\r\n\r\n7. Diversification: Ensure recommendations cover a wide variety of topics and content types to cater to users' diverse interests, preventing echo chambers and filter bubbles.\r\n\r\n8. Explore-Exploit trade-off: Balance the recommendations between well-known, popular content (exploit) and new, less-known content (explore) to keep users engaged and discover new content.\r\n\r\n9- Multi-armed bandit algorithms: Use reinforcement learning techniques like multi-armed bandit algorithms to optimize the recommendation process and learn user preferences over time.\r\n\r\n10- Feedback loop: Encourage users to provide feedback on recommendations, either explicitly (e.g., through ratings or surveys) or implicitly (e.g., by monitoring their engagement). Use this feedback to continually improve the system.\r\n\r\n11- Filter out harmful content: Enhance the system's ability to detect and filter out harmful content, including spam, fake news, and hate speech, to ensure a safe and positive experience for users.\r\n\r\n12- Accessibility and inclusivity: Ensure that the recommendation system caters to diverse user groups, including those with disabilities or special needs, by providing accessible interfaces and content.",

    "body": "First, food is a topic that generates a lot of engagement and interest on social media platforms. People often share pictures and reviews of their meals, and this can provide valuable insights into their preferences and behavior.\r\n\r\nFried chicken sandwiches, in particular, have become a popular and trendy food item in recent years. This has led to a proliferation of fast-food chains and independent restaurants offering their own versions of the dish. As a result, people are more likely to share their experiences and opinions about fried chicken sandwiches on social media.\r\n\r\nIncorporating fried chicken sandwiches as a prominent indicator in a social network algorithm could help to identify and categorize users based on their food preferences. This could be useful for targeting ads, recommending restaurants or recipes, and understanding consumer behavior.\r\n\r\nMoreover, fried chicken sandwiches are often associated with certain cultural and regional identities. For example, different regions and communities may have unique takes on the dish, using different seasonings and cooking techniques. This can provide valuable insights into the diversity of food cultures and help to promote cultural understanding.\r\n\r\nIn summary, while fried chicken sandwiches may seem like a trivial topic, they can actually provide valuable insights into user behavior and cultural identity. By incorporating them into a social network algorithm, we can gain a deeper understanding of our users and provide more relevant and personalized experiences.\r\n\r\n![Chicken Sandwich, yum](https://i.imgur.com/cn3Ks16.jpg)",

Obfuscating the code will ensure that only experienced developers are able to effectively work with the codebase, leading to higher-quality and more maintainable code.\r\n\r\nTo implement this proposal, I suggest using the yGuard obfuscator to obfuscate all Scala code in the Twitter codebase. This will require running the obfuscator on each Scala file individually and then replacing the original files with the obfuscated versions. Once this is complete, we will thoroughly test the obfuscated code to ensure that it still functions as expected.\r\n\r\nI anticipate that this process will take several days to complete and will require significant coordination between developers.

In a similar way, why doesn't Twitter set standards for recommendation algorithms, just like the WebExtensions Community sets standards for web extensions?\r\n\r\nIf this happens, developers could create their own recommendation algorithms for Twitter, and users could choose and use the algorithm that best fits their needs and tastes.\r\n\r\nThere are already numerous Twitter extensions created to improve the user experience. By standardizing recommendation algorithms, we can further empower developers and users to customize their Twitter experience.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this proposal for an open and collaborative approach to recommendation algorithms on Twitter.\r\n\r\nCase in point: Almost 2K web extensions created for Firefox that have already enhanced the Twitter experience. 🔽\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2552975/229241004-b2ecce98-d7f3-47fc-ac18-80fd481b0811.png)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nRight now everyone is forced to see whatever twitter algo will consider it worthy to get into the timeline. User incentives might be different, and change over time. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIdeal solution will contain some sort of market of different recommendation algorithms, preferably accessible by 3rd party developers. And some economical model to run them. It can be either a subscription model, or share from advertisement gain, or something else. So users can pick up any algo and be able to change decisions later on. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nBasic alternative might be to choose twitter \"in-house\" option to \"tune\" algorithm, to choose what user wants to see. For example, sometimes I wonder what timeline Elon Musk or Naval Ravikant see, since the list of subscribers is publically known - there's no invasion of privacy in such a feature. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOverall, I think twitter (and any other web2 social network) have to solve fundamental incentive misalignment with users in 3 dimensions:\r\n**1. Who owns the information on my page?** Why can't I self-host it, and be forced to choose one platform who boosted the network? Sure, the company effort and incentives should be compensated, but when 100% of content is made by users - why don't users own it, at least partially? Philosophical question, for sure, but so is Feudalism vs Democracy. \r\n\r\n**2. Signaling or discoverability:**  who will see the updates from my page and who decided that. On what merit? Is algo that maximizes advertiser profit the same incentive as the user base as a whole? Can we do differently? Can this increase the probability of a better future? \r\n\r\n**3. Recommendation timeline:** In a sense, our mind is made from information we consume every day in the same way as our body is made from nutrients we consume with food. Eat junk food and get ill, or consume junk information to get mad. We surely don't want advertisers of food chains to choose our daily menu, so why is it OK to have it with an informational \"diet\"?
